# Synchronized Video Stream

Simple Flask application that lets multiple users watch the same video in sync.

## Setup

Install dependencies (preferably in a virtualenv):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in several browser tabs to test synchronization.
